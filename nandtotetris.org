** [[https://class.coursera.org/nand2tetris1-001/wiki/week_1][Week 1: Boolean Functions and Gate Logic]]
   In a nutshell: We will start with a brief introduction of Boolean algebra, and learn how Boolean functions can be physically 
   implemented using logic gates. We will then learn how to specify gates and chips using a Hardware Description Language (HDL), 
   and how to simulate the behaviour of the resulting chip specifications using a hardware simulator. This background will set 
   the stage for Project 1, in which you will build, simulate, and test 15 elementary logic gates. The chipset that you will 
   build this week will be later used to construct the computer's Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) and memory system. This will be 
   done in weeks 2 and 3, respectively.

      x || y = y || x
    • Associative lows
      (x && (y && z)) = ((x && y) && z)
      (x || (y || z)) = ((x || y) || z)
    • Distributive lows
      (x && (y || z)) = (x && y) || (x && z)
      (x || (y && z)) = (x || y) && (x || z)
    • De Morgan laws
      ~(x && y) = ~x || ~y
      ~(x || y) = ~x && ~y

    Proof:
    1. ~x = (x NADN x)
    2. (x & y) = ~(x NAND y)
    3. (x || y) = NOT[ NOT( A AND A ) AND NOT( B AND B )]

    • It is conceptually convenient to think about such a group of bits
      as a single entity, sometimes termed "bus" - latin word menaing many, multiple.
