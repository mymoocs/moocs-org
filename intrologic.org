**** Propositiona Sentences
    * Simple(proposition constants) - express single facts about the world
    * Compound - express logical relationsheeps among simpler sentences of which composed
      1) Negation - target
      2) Conjuction - tha argument of conjuction are called conjucts
      3) Disjunction - disjuncts
      4) Implication (p=>q) - p: antecedent(ենթադրյալ), q:consequent (հետևանք)
      5) Reduction (q <= p) - q: consequent, p: antecedent
      6) Equivalence / Biconditional (p <=> q)
    * Precendence of connectives (նախորդում, ավելի բարձր դիրք, приоритет)
      ~
      &
      v
      =>, <=, <=>
**** Proposition Language
     is the set of all propositional sentences that can be formed from propositional vocabulary.
     1. Proposition vocabulary is a set/sequence of proposition constants.

    Evaluation procedure
    1) Replace proposition constants by their truth values.
    2) Use operator semantics to simplify compound sentences with truth values as arguments.
    3) Repeat this inside-out fashion to produce a value for the sentence as a whole.

*** DONE 2.4 Satisfaction (3 min)
    CLOSED: [2015-03-21 Sat 06:53] SCHEDULED: <2015-03-21 Sat>
    Satisfication procedure
    (1) Form a truth table for the proposition constants and add columns for each sentence in our set.
    (2) Evaluate each sentence for each of the rows ot the truth table.
    (3) Any row that satisfy al sentences int the set is a solution to the problem.

    Stanford people always tell the truth, and Berkeley people always lie.
    Unfortunately, by looking at a person, you cannot tell whether he is 
    from Stanford or Berkeley.
    You came to a fork in the road and want to get to the football
    stadium down one fork. However, you do not know which to take.
    There is a person standing there. What single question you can 
    ask him to help you decide which fork to take?

    | left | from stanford | Question | Response |   |
    |------+---------------+----------+----------+---|
    |    1 |             1 |        1 |        1 | + |

    Question: Is it the case that the left road the way to the stadium if and only if you are from Stanford?

    ▶SAT: determines wheather a set of propositional sentences is satisfiable.
    Logic problems react as SAT problems (e.g entailment)
    SAT solvers used in
    - Haedware design
    - Software analysis
    - Planning
    - Mathematics

   
    ▶Methods used in SAT
    1. Complete methods
    Guraranteed to give correct answer
    Truth Tables
    Backtracking search (Поиск с возвратом)

    2. Incomplete methods
    Not guraranteed to give correct answer
    Local Search

    ▶Example
    Let Ψ = {p v q, p v ~q, ~p v q, ~p v ~q v ~r, ~p v r}
    Q: is Ψ satisfiable? Thas there is exsit a truth assignment that satisfied every sentence in Ψ?
    Assume each sentence in Ψ is a disjunction of atmos or negated atoms
    Solution:
    • Truth Table method - Complete method
    | p | q | r | p v q | p v ~q | ~p v q | ~p v ~q v ~r | ~p v r | Ψ sat. |
    |---+---+---+-------+--------+--------+--------------+--------+--------|
    | 0 | 0 | 0 |     0 |      1 |      1 |            1 |      0 | no     |
    | 0 | 0 | 1 |     0 |      1 |      1 |            1 |      1 | no     |
    | 0 | 1 | 0 |     1 |      0 |      1 |            1 |      1 | no     |
    | 0 | 1 | 1 |     1 |      0 |      1 |            1 |      1 | no     |
    | 1 | 0 | 0 |     1 |      1 |      0 |            1 |      0 | no     |
    | 1 | 0 | 1 |     1 |      1 |      0 |            1 |      1 | no     |
    | 1 | 1 | 0 |     1 |      1 |      1 |            1 |      0 | no     |
    | 1 | 1 | 1 |     1 |      1 |      1 |            0 |      1 | no     |
    |---+---+---+-------+--------+--------+--------------+--------+--------|
    Complete: thruth table method is complete, because we examine every single truth assignment
    Impractical except for small examples
    rows
    * 2 ^ 3 = 8
    * 2 ^ 10 = 1024
    * 2 ^ 20 = 1 million (10 ^ 6)
    * 2 ^ 30 = 1 billion (10 ^ 9)
    * 2 ^ 40 = 1 trillion(10 ^ 12)
      
   • Partial assignments
       | p | q | r | p v q | p v ~q | ~p v q | ~p v ~q v ~r | ~p v r | Ψ sat. |
       |---+---+---+-------+--------+--------+--------------+--------+--------|
       |   |   |   |       |        |        |              |        |        |
       | 1 | 0 | ? |     1 |      1 |      0 |            1 |      ? | no     |
       | 1 | 0 | ? |     1 |      1 |      0 |            1 |      ? | no     | 
       |   |   |   |       |        |        |              |        |        | 
       |   |   |   |       |        |        |              |        |        | 
       |---+---+---+-------+--------+--------+--------------+--------+--------|
       because we have already the False in row and we do not need to check other 
       sentences, we already no that answer is no. 
   
   • Searching partial assignments instead of only complete assignments.
     Tree like 
                              ???
                             /    \
                       p false    p true
                      0??
                     /
        this idea base rise to the basic backtracking search
     
    
   ▶ Basic backtracking search
   Essential backtracking search optiomization 
   * Unit propagation
   * Pure Literal elimination
   Most modern complete SAT sovlers are based on variations of DPLL (Davis-Putman-Logemann-Loveland)
   * Clause Learning
   * Fast Propagation
   * Proposition selection heuristicc
     
         
   ➤ incomplete method 
   Some SAT problems still impractical for complete SAT sovlers
   Little opportunity for early pruning (Էտում)
   Consider method that answer correctly most of the time, but not every time
