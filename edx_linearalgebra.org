** Unit 1: Entering the Matrix
   RECAP:
        -  Gain an overview perspective of applications of linear algebra
        -  Be able to distinguish between linear and nonlinear equations
        -  Learn terminology of related to matrices
        -  Learn an algorithm that uses a matrix to visually approximate
           an image using ASCII characters.

*** 1.1 - When Life is Linear  (04:08)
    INFO: will gain an appreciation for how linear processes can model 
          or approximation the world.  We will also look specifically 
          at wireframe models that create 3D models.
