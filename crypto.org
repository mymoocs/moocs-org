    ▶ Cryptography is everywhere
    • Secure Communication
    * web traffic: HTTPS
    * wireless traffic: 802.11i WPA2, GSM, Bluetooth
    • Encrypted files on disk: EFS, TrueCrypt
    • Content Protection (e.g. DVD, Blue-ray): CSS, AACS
    • User Authentication

    • Secure Communication
    no eavesdroping
    no tampering
    Secure Socket Layer / TLS
    the protocol used to secure Web traffic called TLS actually consists of two main parts.
    1) Handshake Protocol: Established shared secret key using public-key cryptography (2nd part of course)
    2) Record Layer: Transmit data using shared secret key. Ensure confidentality and integrity (1st part of course)
    
    • Protected file on disk
    like communciation scenario, Alice encrypt files and send to Alice tommorow to read
    ▶ Building blog: symmetric encryption systems
    1) k     secret key(e.g. 128 bits) that share Alice and Bob
    2) E,D   cipher algorithms
       E     called an encryption algorithm, E(k,m)=c
       D     called an decryption algorithm, D(k,c)=m
    3) m,c   plain text, ciphertext
    
    Encryption algorithms (E,D) is publicy known, onbly thing that is kept secret is the secret key k.
    
    
    ▶ Use cases
    • Single use key: (one time key)
    Key is obly used to encrypt one message
    e.g. encrypted email: new key generated for every email
    
    • Multi use key: (many time key)
    Key used to encryt multile messages - e.g. encrypted files: same key used to encrypt many files 
    Need more machinery than for one-time key
