  That said, it is one of the two books I encourage newcomers to Haskell to pick up. 
  The other is Real World Haskell (RWH), which has complementary strengths and weaknesses to those of LYaH. 

** Learn You a Haskell for Great Good!
** Real World Haskell
   
   From there if you want to continue, you can dive deeper with

** Pearls of Functional Algorithm Design
** Parallel and Concurrent Programming in Haskell 
** Purely Functional Data Structures
** Types and Programming Languages Benjamin C. Pierce
** Basic Category Theory for Computer Scientists
