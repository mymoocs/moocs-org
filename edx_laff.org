** Week 1: Vectors in Linear Algebra
*** What will learn
    • Represent quantities that have a magnitude and a direction as vectors.
    • Read, write, and interpret vector notations.
    • Visualize vectors in R2.
    • Perform the vector operations of scaling, addition, dot (inner) product.
    • Reason and develop arguments about properties of vectors and operations defined on them.
    • Compute the (Euclidean) length of a vector.
    • Express the length of a vector in terms of the dot product of that vector with itself.
    • Evaluate a vector function.
    • Solve simple problems that can be represented with vectors.
    • Create code for various vector operations and determine their cost functions in terms of the size of the vectors.
    • Gain an awareness of how linear algebra software evolved over time and how our programming assignments fit into this. (enrichment)
    • Become aware of overflow and underflow in computer arithmetic. (enrichment)
