    nano - 10 e-9
    nanotechnology - 1-100nm
    finger nail grows 1nm per second
    red blood cell = 10000nm
    1) In nanomateerials the surface/boundary/interface plays an important role!.
       1x1 santimenter cube, total surface area is 6 sm ^ 2
       1x1 mm cubes, area = 60 sm ^ 2
       1x1 nm cubes, area = 60 000 000 sm ^ 2
    2) Surface are to volume ratio
       Silicon (Si) has diamond structure with a = 5.43A
       10x10nm Si nanocube on a side is composed of: 6250 unit cells, 50000 atoms
    3) Chemical active
       Since many more molecules are located on the surface are in energetically unstable
